I spent a fair 2 days on this task. I already completed 3 of my tasks from 11th nov to 14th nov but while trying to uoload this to remote repo I lost all my progress and the whole terminal hunt folder was uploaded into my repo. Even the revert push command did nothing I had to start over. Anyway now I cloned my repo into my device and manually changes the solutions folder position to amfoss repo using terminal and then git push origin mained. HAHA. For basics [this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh3N_MvU1LI) helped me. 
Now I started a [blog](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7674270757009873995/3387598984513281582) for  myself to write down the important commands.
