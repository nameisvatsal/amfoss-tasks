# TASK-00 INSTALL UBUNTU 22.04[LTS].
This was easy to begin with . But I faced an issue for not enrolling mok when it asked me to but, later I found [this article](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot/DKMS) and re enrolled mok ( I turned off secure boot too). [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKn5U2esuRk) helped me do the duall boot with no data loss.
