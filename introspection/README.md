# Why must we choose you?
I'm a quick learner. I can multitask dynamically. I have learned C-Language and am moderately good at it. My goal is to get a job solely based on coding. So recieving guidance from seniors gives me an immense progress boost for my career. Basically, amFOSS club suits my passion.I'm an immense tech-savvy.


# What is your plan for the next 6 months?
In the next 6 months I see myself in a position where I can be able to solve many of the coding related problems with ease. I also want to get good SGPA for SEM-1. Although Linux is new to me I'm striving to get used to it.


# How would you contribute back to the club? 
I will try hard to achieve something that the club can vaunt-off. I will give my level-best to make the club renowned. I'm also looking forward to mentor some of my juniors. 


# Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
This might seem like beating around the bush but , being new to linux and its commands, without prior knowledge about those commands, make it difficult for tryouts to join the club. Anyways in the end it all adds up , because discovering these things on their own makes it easier in the fututre. HARDWORK ALWAYS PAYSOFF.
